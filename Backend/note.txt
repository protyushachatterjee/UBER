1.the route will be created in router file.

2.the user/captain user will be created in service file

3.all inside things will be created in controller inclusing hashing, generate token, comparing password.

4.user data will be created on user model and main code of generating token, hashing password, comparing password will be writing here.

5.register logic => 
        validate err, 
        if no err then,
        get data field from req.body, 
        hashpassword,
        check if user is already present or not,
        if not then create user
        generate token and send the token and user to response.

6. login logic => 
        validate err,
        if not then get email and password from body,
        then check if the email and,
        compare the password and check if present or not,
        if yes then generate token,
        then send it to the cookie along with token and user

7. profile logic =>
        res.status(200).json({captain: req.captain});

8. logout logic =>
        check if token is there or not,
        then blacklist then token by creating that token as blacklisted,
        clear that token.                

9.middleware logic =>
        check if token is is present or not
        if no then send "auothorized" 
        if yes then check the token is blacklisted or not
        if yes then send "auothorized"
        otherwise 
        try{
        const decoded= jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
        const user= await userModels.findById(decoded._id);

        req.user= user;
        return next();
        
    } catch(err){
        return res.status(401).json({message: 'Unauthorized'});
    }

10. For Map Api make a new controller and service and create a Address, Distance & time calculation and Suggetion service
as well as routes.

in service file: 
        1.Get the Api key
        2.Create the API url
        3.in try-catch block if the data is coming by axios then show data other wise error
        4.in Catch block handle the expection error.

in controller file:
        1. check the error from validationResult
        2.if error comes the show error if not
        3.take the data from req.query & 
        const {input} = req.query;
        const data = await mapService.getAutoComplete(input);
        res.status(200).json(data);
